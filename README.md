# Stock Prediction

Project Title: Stock Market Analysis and Prediction for Major Tech Companies

Project Description:
This project focused on analyzing and predicting the stock performance of four major tech companies: Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). Using data from Yahoo Finance and various Python libraries, the project provided insights into stock trends, risk, and potential returns. Additionally, it included predictive modeling for Apple's stock prices, applying Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast future prices based on historical data.

Key Steps and Analysis:

Data Collection: Acquired historical stock data for each company using yfinance, covering key variables like Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume.
Data Processing & Visualization:
Price Trend Analysis: Visualized closing prices over time to identify historical trends.
Volume Analysis: Analyzed daily trading volume to capture trading activity patterns.
Moving Averages: Calculated and plotted moving averages (10-day, 20-day, and 50-day) to smooth out price fluctuations and reveal long-term trends.
Daily Returns and Risk Assessment:
Daily Return Calculation: Calculated daily returns for each stock to measure volatility and returns over time.
Return Distributions: Visualized the distribution of daily returns using histograms and KDE plots to understand the risk associated with each stock.
Correlation Analysis: Assessed correlation between the stocks to gauge how they move relative to each other, providing insights into diversification.
Predictive Modeling with LSTM:
LSTM Model: Built and trained an LSTM model to predict Appleâ€™s closing prices, leveraging the sequential nature of stock data. This deep learning approach enabled a time-based forecast, helping to anticipate future stock movements.
Technologies & Tools Used:

Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization; Keras for building the LSTM model.
Data Source: Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library.
Visualization: Trendlines, moving averages, volume, and risk-return visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Outcome:
The project provided a comprehensive analysis of tech stock performance over a year, highlighting trends, volatility, and potential risks. The LSTM model demonstrated predictive capabilities, adding value for portfolio management and investment decision-making.
